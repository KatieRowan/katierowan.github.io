    <h3>06<br/>Takeaways</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="col-7">
    <p class="case-study-body"><b>1. Demos and tutorials are important.</b> Through testing, I was able to identify points of confusion for users. I incorporated them into the tutorial to alleviate later confusion without needing to restructure the entire app.</p>
    <p class="case-study-body"><b>2. Small adjustments make a big difference.</b> By using the golden ratio and tweaking the colors of Primary's logo, it became tighter and more harmonious, working well in both small and large sizes. I used an 8-pt. grid while designing each screen of the app to ensure adequate, consistent spacing. These changes, however small, made the app and brand identity stronger.</p>
    <p class="case-study-body"><b>3. You have to narrow your focus for an MVP.</b> The biggest requirement for the first version of this app is to empower voters to do their own research and make informed decisions. I scrapped the idea of a discussion feed to narrow the focus of this first iteration. Going forward, I'd like to incorporate some way of encouraging word-of-mouth, whether that be through a discussion feed or through a sharing feature.</p>
